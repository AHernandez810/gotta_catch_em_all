# GottaCatchEmAll

Welcome to the GottaCatchEmAll gem! This is an interactive gem that provides a few basic information on all 151 original POKEMON, such as their weight, height, exp, types, moves and abilities. Thank you for downloading this Ruby Gem!


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gotta_catch_em_all'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gotta_catch_em_all

## Usage

Launch the gem file while in the main Gotta_Catch_Em_All folder and types "./bin/run"

Follow the prompts in a series of yes or no answers or by simply inputting the id number attached to the POKEMON name being displayed. You have the option to view other POKEMON one at a time and simply exit the program once you are done.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
